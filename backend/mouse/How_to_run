The "Live Mouse Control Using Hand Gestures" project leverages computer vision to enable mouse control through hand gestures, utilizing MediaPipe for hand tracking. To set up and run the project, ensure Python 3.10+ is installed, then clone the project repository. For a clean setup, create a virtual environment (`python -m venv env`), activate it (on Windows, `.\env\Scripts\activate`; on macOS/Linux, `source env/bin/activate`), and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This file includes all required libraries, such as `mediapipe` for gesture recognition, `matplotlib` for any potential visualizations, and `python-dateutil` and `six` for date handling and compatibility functions. Once set up, start the project with `python main.py`. For any “module not found” errors, re-run the installation command or manually install any missing package with `pip install <package-name>`. For smooth operation, make sure your webcam is functional and that all packages are up-to-date, especially `six` and `python-dateutil`. When done, you can exit the virtual environment with `deactivate`. This project, which works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, requires an enabled webcam for gesture detection and is best supported on Python 3.10+.
